<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Screenshot][product-screenshot]](https://github.com/longpdo/youtube-dl-watch-later-playlist/)

`youtube-dl-watch-later-playlist.py` is a python script to automatically download all YouTube videos from your current Watch Later Playlist. The script will start `Chromedriver` and login to your Google Account.

Logging in to your Google Account is currently done by signing up at `stackoverflow.com` via Google, since logging in to Google directly at YouTube won't work due to Google not trusting automated Webbrowsers like `Chromedriver`. The workaround works, since `stackoverflow.com` is one of the trusted apps by Google.

The script also works when your Google Account has `Two-Factor Authentication` activated and will wait for 5 minutes before throwing a TimeoutException.

After successfully logging in to Google and being redirected to `stackoverflow.com`, `Chromedriver` will move to `https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=WL` and crawl the links for all the videos in the playlist and the script will start downloading them with `youtube-dl`.
